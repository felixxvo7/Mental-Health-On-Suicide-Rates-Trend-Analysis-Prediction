# Mental Health and Suicide Trends Analysis (2002â€“2022)

## 1. Tentative Analysis Questions

### 1. Descriptive Analysis

-   How have mental health indicators changed over time (2002, 2012, 2022) across different demographics (age, province, sex)?
-   What are the suicide rate trends in Canada over the 20-year period? and demographic wise?
-   Are there provincial variations in mental health indicators and suicide rates?
-   How have inflation and CPI trends varied across provinces over time?

### 2. Inferential Analysis & Hypothesis Testing

-   Is there a statistically significant relationship between mental health disorders and suicide rates?
-   Do certain demographic groups (age, sex, province) have significantly higher suicide rates?
-   Has inflation (CPI) and Inflation rate impacted suicide rates or mental health disorder prevalence?

### 3. Predictive Analysis

-   Can we accurately predict high-risk groups for suicide using mental health indicators and economic factors (CPI, inflation)?
-   Which mental health disorders have the strongest association with suicide rates?
-   Which machine learning model (Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression) performs best in predicting suicide risk?
-   How well do mental health disorders correlate with suicide trends across provinces and demographic groups?
-   Which factors (mental health indicators, economic conditions, demographics) contribute most to suicide risk?

### 4.Trend & Sentiment Analysis (Reddit Data Integration)

-   How do public discussions on mental health (from Reddit sentiment analysis) align with actual suicide rates and disorder prevalence?
-   Can we detect emerging mental health crises using Reddit sentiment trends?

## 2. Methods:

### 1. Preprocessing:

-   Handling missing data using imputation techniques.
-   Standardization & Normalization of numerical data (CPI, inflation, suicide rates).

### 2. Modeling:

#### 1. Logistic Regression:

Baseline model for binary classification (e.g., high vs. low suicide risk).

#### 2. SVM

Detect complex patterns in suicide risk classification based on mental health and economic factors.

#### 3. Random Forest

Identify feature importance and non-linear relationships between predictors and suicide risk.

### 3. Sentiment Analysis on Reddit Data

-   Scrape/Collect Reddit posts related to mental health using API or datasets.
-   Perform Sentiment Analysis (VADER, TextBlob, or BERT-based models).
-   Compare sentiment trends with actual suicide rates (correlation analysis, time-series comparisons).
-   Topic Modeling (LDA) to find recurring themes in mental health discussions.

### 4. Model Interpretation & Insights

Feature Importance from Random Forest to rank key predictors. SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) Analysis to explain ML model predictions. Trend Visualization (Heatmaps, Time-Series Charts, Word Clouds for Reddit).
